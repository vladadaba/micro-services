## This is a project to test out solutions to common problems when developing microservices.

### Some things that I want to test out:
- [x] Kafka and Outbox pattern
- [x] CQRS with Mediatr
  * Entity Framework Core (for commands)
  * Dapper (for queries)
- [x] Code-first DB and migrations with EF Core
- [x] Envoy proxy acting as API gateway
- [ ] Centralized logging (ELK) with correlation ID
- [ ] Saga pattern (Choreography variant)
- [ ] Event sourcing
- [ ] OAuth and Authorization
- [ ] Caching (Redis or Memcached)
- [ ] Schema registry and AVRO serialization
- [ ] Cursor or Keyset pagination
- [ ] Simple React frontend
- [ ] WebSockets
- [ ] Health checks that work with Kubernetes

### And some DevOps stuff:
- [ ] Build pipeline in Jenkins
- [ ] Deployment with Kubernetes
- [ ] Chaos engineering

Will add more stuff here...
