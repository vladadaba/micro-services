## This is a project to test out solutions to common problems when developing microservices.

Some things that I want to test out are:
* OAuth
* Kafka and Outbox pattern
* Saga pattern
* CQRS
  * Entity Framework Core (for updates)
  * Dapper (for reads)
* Event sourcing
* DB migrations with EF Core
* WebSockets
* Cursor paging

Maybe later on:
* Chaos engineering
* Build pipeline in Jenkins
* Deployment with Kubernetes

Will add more stuff here...
