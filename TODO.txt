- set index on timestamp? what if 2 jobs have exact same timestamp and page breaks in between (we will skip a record)? maybe better to use new autoincrement column

- implement keyset pagination on get all jobs api (naturally ordered by newly created autoincrement column descending)

- insert many rows for testing

CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp"; -- so we can use uuid_generate_v4() function

INSERT INTO job_items (id, name, status, created_at)
	select uuid_generate_v4(), name, 0, now()
		from generate_series(1, 100000) as t(name);
